📌 Project Title
Rice Plant Leaf Disease Detection using Image Processing in MATLAB

📝 Project Description
This project focuses on detecting diseases in rice plant leaves using image processing and machine learning techniques implemented in MATLAB. The system is designed to classify healthy and diseased leaves by analyzing visual symptoms using pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification stages.

The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural experts by automating the disease diagnosis process, enabling early detection and reducing crop damage. By leveraging color, texture, and shape features from the images, the system can identify common rice plant diseases such as Leaf Blast, Brown Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight.
